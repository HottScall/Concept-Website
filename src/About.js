    <p>I don’t have a brother or sister. I want one.</p>

      Tell me, lady, how could it be that I wouldn’t be born? Where would I be?
      High in the sky? On another planet?

      The sparrows disappeared from our town in the first year after the
      accident. They were lying around everywhere – in the yards, on the
      asphalt. They’d be raked up and taken away in the containers with the
      leaves. They didn’t let people burn the leaves that year, because they
      were radioactive, so they buried the leaves.

      The sparrows came back two years later. We were so happy, we were calling
      to each other: “I saw a sparrow yesterday! They’re back.”

      The May bugs also disappeared, and they haven’t come back. Maybe they’ll
      come back in a hundred years or a thousand. That’s what our teacher says.
      I won’t see them.

      September first, the first day of school, and there wasn’t a single
      flower. The flowers were radioactive. Before the beginning of the year,
      the people working weren’t masons, like before, but soldiers. They mowed
      the flowers, took off the earth and took it away somewhere in cars with
      trailers.

      In a year they evacuated all of us and buried the village. My father’s a
      cab driver, he drove there and told us about it. First they’d tear a big
      pit in the ground, five meters deep. Then the firemen would come up and
      use their hoses to wash the house from its roof to its foundation, so that
      no radioactive dust gets kicked up. They wash the windows, the roof, the
      door, all of it. Then a crane drags the house from its spot and puts it
      down into the pit. There’s dolls and books and cans all scattered around.
      The excavator picks them up. Then it covers everything with sand and clay,
      leveling it. And then instead of a village, you have an empty field. They
      sowed our land with corn. Our house is lying there, and our school and our
      village council office. My plants are there and two albums of stamps, I
      was hoping to bring them with me. Also I had a bike.

      I’m twelve years old and I’m an invalid. The mailman brings two pension
      checks to our house – for me and my granddad. When the girls in my class
      found out that I had cancer of the blood, they were afraid to sit next to
      me. They didn’t want to touch me.

      The doctors said that I got sick because my father worked at Chernobyl.
      And after that I was born. I love my father.
