      There was a black cloud, and hard rain. The puddles were yellow and green,
      like someone had poured paint into them. They said it was dust from the
      flowers. Grandma made us stay in the cellar. She got down on her knees and
      prayed. And she taught us, too. “Pray! It’s the end of the world. It’s
      God’s punishment for our sins.” My brother was eight and I was six. We
      started remembering our sins. He broke the glass can with the raspberry
      jam, and I didn’t tell my mom that I’d got my new dress caught on a fence
      and it ripped. I hid it in the closet.

      Soldiers came for us in cars. I thought the war had started. They were
      saying these things: “deactivation,” “isotopes.” One soldier was chasing
      after a cat. The dosimeter was working on the cat like an automatic:
      click, click. A boy and a girl were chasing the cat, too. The boy was all
      right, but the girl kept crying, “I won’t give him up!” She was yelling:
      “Run away, run little girl!” But the soldier had a big plastic bag.

      I heard – the adults were talking – Grandma was crying – since the year I
      was born [1986], there haven’t been any boys or girls born in our village.
      I’m the only one. The doctors said I couldn’t be born. But my mom ran away
      from the hospital and hid at Grandma’s. So I was born at Grandma’s. I
      heard them talking about it.
